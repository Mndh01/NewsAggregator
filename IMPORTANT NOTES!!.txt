In this file you'll find the technical issues related to this assignment and the workarounds I used to solve them with some notes to bare in mind while evaluating the assignment.

## Technical Issues and workarounds:

1. **Issue** The first two requirments in the assignment are basically the same and if there is a different it was not made clear.
   **Solution** I combined the first two requirements into one requirement and added filtering as I saw fitting. 

2. **Issue** Most of the resouces mentioned in the assignment are not available in the internet except for three of them.
   **Solution** I had to use the only existing three resources: 1- NewsApi.org, 2- New York Times API, 3- The Guardian API.

3. **Issue** Only the NewsApi.org supports the filtering of news by the source and it doesn't support mixing this filter with filters like category and country.
   **Solution** I applied the filtering by source only to NewsApi.org and if this filter was applied by the user,
                I made it so that it ignores the category filter in order for it to work (otherwise an error will occur in the API).

4. **Issue** The New York Times API and The Guardian API don't support filtering by source.
    **Solution** I had to use the category filter only for these two APIs.

5. **Issue** The APIs don't provide an endpoint for getting the categories available in the API.
    **Solution** I had to hardcode some of the shared categories among the APIs (Not all categories apply to all APIs though).

## Notes:

1. For the first issue I could reach out to the HR and ask for clarification on the first two requirements because it was weekend.

2. While testing the assignment bare in mind that all of the keys used for the APIs are free development keys 
    so they are limited by number of calls per second/minute and by number of calls per day (Keys can be found in ".env" file).
